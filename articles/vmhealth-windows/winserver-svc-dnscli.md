# DNS Client service health

## Summary

The DNS Client service resolves and caches Domain Name System (DNS) names. If this service is stopped, a virtual machine will not be able to resolve DNS names and locate Active Directory domain controllers.

## Causes

A service can stop for many reasons, including:

- The service was stopped by an Administrator.
- The service encountered an exception that stopped the service.
- The service was improperly configured, which prevented it from starting.
- The service was prevented from starting because the user account assigned to the service could not be authenticated.

## Resolutions

The service can be restarted using the **Services** snap-in, using the **Net Start** command, or from PowerShell using **Start-Service** cmdlet.
